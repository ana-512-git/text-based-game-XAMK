# The Return
A text-based desktop game, made using C# and Unity. This game was developed as an assignment for the
XAMK Intro to Game Creation course. In this game, the player is a traveller that must interact
with their surroundings to explore the game world.
## How to play

### Gameplay
You wake up on the shore of a forgotten island, the salty breeze carrying whispers of a past you 
can’t remember. A crumbling chapel looms ahead, its doors groaning open as if inviting you in. 
Inside, dust-covered relics and cryptic carvings hint at a buried secret. But you’re not 
alone—something stirs in the shadows. Armed only with your wits and the staff you helped yourself up
with, you must face a lurking foe before escaping.

Beyond the ruins, a lone fisherman waits by the shore. He offers you passage—but only if you can 
answer his riddles, each one drawn from the events you’ve witnessed. Fail, and you remain trapped. 
Succeed, and you can finally escape the island.

### Controls
Interaction with the game world happens via the text box situated at the bottom-middle side of the
game.

In order to explore the world, the player has to type prompts made of a verb and noun pair, 
followed by an enter. Allowed nouns are written in bold throughout the story, like this:

The following verbs are allowed: "(...)". If, during the game, you want to revisit these rules, 
type "help" followed by enter in the text box and a short manual page will appear, listing the 
allowed verbs and the prompt syntax, like this:
